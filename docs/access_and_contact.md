# Access and Contact
The server can be accessed internally via this address [https://a2s-cluster.inf.h-brs.de](a2s-cluster.inf.h-brs.de)

## Getting Access
To access the server, please send an email to <mohammad.wasil@h-brs.de> or <sebastian.houben@h-brs.de> with the following information:
* Purpose of use (e.g. course project, R&D, or MT)
* Time frame (how long you need the access e.g. the earliest and latest access)
* Number of GPUs required
* Shared or dedicated GPUs (shared means access to GPUs shared with other users, while dedicated means exclusive access)
* Image to use (default image provided if not specified)

:::info
Note that unlike the university cluster, your access to the server is limited to the length of your project e.g. 8 months for an R&D project and 6 months for MT, but you will have unlimited access in terms of runtime during that period. Also, the resource allocation depends on availability.
